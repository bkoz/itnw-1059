            <p>
                I currently work for <a href="https://www.redhat.com">Red Hat</a> as a Domain Architect where I help
                organizations evaluate open source technologies used to deploy backend web applications. The customers I work with
                are looking to migrate workloads from virtual machines running application servers to platforms based
                on Linux containers such as <a href="https://www.redhat.com/openshift">OpenShift.</a> I'm hoping the classes at <a href="http://continue.austincc.edu/webmaster">ACC</a>                will give me a better understanding of front end web developement and round out my professional skill set.
            </p>
            <p>
                My prior work experience included working with three dimensional graphics and high performance computing in a pre-sales capacity
                where I authored short example programs used in demonstrations and proof of concepts.

            <h3>Amateur Stuff</h3>
            <p>When I'm not working or taking classes, I like to study and play guitar with other members of the <a href="http://austinclassicalguitar.org">Austin Classical 
                    Guitar Society Ensemble.</a>

            To create a second section, I decided to make reference to
            <a href="http://www.abrahamlincolnonline.org/lincoln/speeches/gettysburg.htm">
                Lincoln's address at Gettysburg.</a>
