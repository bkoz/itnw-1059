Description: The landing page for my portfolio. I used the gimp
program to add an alpha channel to the bk.gif file and set the
white pixels to be transparent.

            <h3>Professional</h3>
            <p>
                I currently work for <a href="https://www.redhat.com">Red Hat</a> as a Domain Architect where I help organizations evaluate open source technologies that are used to develop back end web applications. The customers I work with are looking
                to migrate workloads from virtual machines running application servers to Linux container platforms such as <a href="https://www.redhat.com/openshift">OpenShift.</a> I'm hoping the
                <a href="http://continue.austincc.edu/webmaster">web developer classes at ACC</a> and completion of my <a href="capstone.html">capstone</a> project will give me a better understanding of front end web development and round out my professional
                skill set.
            </p>
            <p>
                My prior work experience included working with three dimensional graphics and high performance computing in a pre-sales and software developer capacity where I authored example programs used for demonstrations and proof of concepts. For additional details
                about my work and education history, please view my <a href="resume.html">resume</a>.

            <h3>Amateur Stuff</h3>
            <p>When I'm not working or taking classes, I like to study and play guitar with other members 
              of the <a href="http://austinclassicalguitar.org">Austin Classical Guitar Society.</a> We rehearse weekly
              and perform recitals in December and the Spring. These are free to the public so I'll hope you'll come
              out and see us sometime.
            </p>
