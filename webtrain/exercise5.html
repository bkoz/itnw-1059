Description: An html page that references an external CSS file.

Create a stylesheet that sets two different sets of attributes for 
the <p> tag. The first uses a background image and colored text in the Arial font written in the 
area. The second uses a background color and larger colored text in the Courier font.

  <h1>Graded Exercise #5</h1>
  <article>
    <h2>Two paragraphs</h2>
    <section>
      <h3>Paragraph 1</h3>
      <p id="paragraph1">
        This is paragraph 1. The style attribute for this paragraph uses a background image of a piece of paper towel. The picture
        was taken with a cell phone and cropped to a smaller size. It appears very dark in color because I did not use a
        flash when I took the photo. The text uses the Aerial font family with a default font size.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h3>Paragraph 2</h3>
      <p id="paragraph2">
        This is paragraph 2. Each paragraph tag contains an id attribute so unique styles can be assigned to each paragraph. The
        text uses the Courier font family with a larger font size.
      </p>
