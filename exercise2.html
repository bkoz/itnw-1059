                This text is enclosed within a paragraph. There should be a blank line 
                above and below the paragraph. In thinking about content to fill up the first
                paragraph, I'll share some highlights about our first three days at the beach. 
                Our flight arrived on time in Charleston, SC. We then
                picked up our rental car and made the two hour trip to Myrtle Beach, SC. I will
                continue this exciting blog entry in the next paragraph.
            </p>
            <p>
                Second paragraph. This is the first sentence which is inside a paragraph within 
                the second section. The weather on Sunday and Monday was sunny, hot and humid
                but eventually, the clouds began to roll in and we got some thunderstorms on
                Tuesday afternoon. Then, after the storm passed, along came the Dolphins. During the day,
                all of the children had fun playing games and became really drunk as the night went on.
