      <h3>Professional</h3>
      <p>
        I currently work for <a href="https://www.redhat.com">Red Hat</a> as a Domain Architect where I help organizations
        evaluate open source technologies used to deploy back end web applications. The customers I work with are looking
        to migrate workloads from virtual machines running application servers to platforms based on Linux containers such
        as <a href="https://www.redhat.com/openshift">OpenShift.</a> I'm hoping the
        <a href="http://continue.austincc.edu/webmaster">web developer classes at ACC</a> and 
        completion of my <a href="capstone.html">capstone</a> project will give me a better understanding
        of front end web development and round out my professional skill set.
      </p>
      <p>
        My prior work experience included working with three dimensional graphics and high performance computing in a pre-sales capacity
        where I authored short example programs used in demonstrations and proof of concepts. For additional
        details about my work history please have a look at my <a href="resume.html">resume</a>.

      <h3>Amateur Stuff</h3>
      <p>When I'm not working or taking classes, I like to study and play guitar with other members of the <a href="http://austinclassicalguitar.org">Austin Classical 
                    Guitar Society Ensemble.</a>
